"""The installer — what has to exist before this extension is usable.

Two things, both idempotent, because a restored site repairs itself on the next
migrate rather than failing on a missing document the first time somebody opens
the widget.

The role is the load-bearing half: an account may use these tools when it holds
``Webshop Mcp User``.  Creating it here rather than in a fixture means a site restored
from a backup gets it back.
